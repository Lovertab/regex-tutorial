# Regex Tutorial: Understanding Email Matching

Regular expressions also known as regex are powerful tools for matching patterns in text. In this tutorial, I will break down a specific regex used to match email addresses.Which can be used to help you validate email addresses effectively and apply similar patterns to other use cases.

## Summary

This tutorial will explain the components of the following regex, which is used to match email addresses:
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors are used to assert the position within the string.

 ^: Asserts the position at the start of the string. Making sure that the match starts at the beginning.
 $: Asserts the position at the end of the string. Making sure that the match ends at the end.
These anchors are very important for ensuring the regex matches the entire string, not just a part of it.

### Quantifiers
 Quantifiers specify how many instances of a character, group, or character class must be present in the input for a match to be found.

 +: Matches one or more of the preceding token. In the regex, it ensures that the local part, domain part, and TLD each have at least one character.

### Grouping Constructs
Grouping constructs are used to group parts of a regex into subpatterns.
 ([a-z0-9_\.-]+): The first capturing group matches the local part of the email.
 ([\da-z\.-]+): The second capturing group matches the domain part of the email.
 ([a-z\.]{2,6}): The third capturing group matches the top-level domain (TLD) of the email.

### Bracket Expressions
 Bracket expressions (character sets) match any one of the enclosed characters.

 [a-z0-9_\.-]: Matches any lowercase letter, digit, underscore, period, or hyphen.
 [\da-z\.-]: Matches any digit, lowercase letter, period, or hyphen.
 [a-z\.]: Matches any lowercase letter or period.
### Character Classes
 Character classes match any single character from a set of characters.

 \d: Shorthand for [0-9], matches any digit.
### The OR Operator
 This regex does not use the OR operator (|), which is used to match one pattern or another.
### Flags
 This regex does not use any flags. Flags are used to modify the behavior of the regex, such as making it case-insensitive.
### Character Escapes
 Character escapes are used to give special meaning to characters that otherwise have a literal meaning.

 \.: Matches a literal period (.). The backslash escapes the period, which normally matches any character except a newline.
